## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a Workout App that enables users to track their workouts, maintain user profiles, access a database of exercises, and receive workout suggestions based on desired calorie counts and durations. The app will consist of three main components: Exercises, Users, and Workouts.

## Components and Definitions

### Exercise
- **Properties:**
  - Name
  - Description
  - Image
  - Average Duration per Repetition
  - Average Calories per Repetition

### User
- **Properties:**
  - Name
  - Password
  - Age
  - User Image
  - Current Weight
  - Historical Weights
  - Historical Workouts (Repetitions, Duration, Calories)

### Workout
- **Properties:**
  - Date/ID
  - List of Exercises
  - Repetitions for Each Exercise
  - Current Calorie Count
  - Current Duration

## App Capabilities

- Database of Exercises
- Database of Users

### User Activities
- Create and authenticate user accounts
- Change passwords
- Track progress (weight, exercise data, calorie count)
- View daily and historical progress reports
- View available exercises with details
- Add new exercises to the database
- Suggest workouts based on target calorie count and/or duration

## Data Model

### Exercise
- ID (integer)
- Name (text)
- Description (text)
- Duration (number)
- Calories per 1 repetition (number)

### User
- Name (text)
- Password
- Email address
- Phone number
- Current weight (number)
- Historical weight (array of numbers)
- Historical workout duration (array of numbers)
- Historical workout calorie count
- Current calorie count
- Current day workout duration

### Workout
- ID number and/or date
- List of exercises
- Repetitions for each exercise
- Current calorie count
- Current duration

## Teamwork

- Collaborative teamwork is essential for project completion.
- Define workflow and distribute workload fairly among team members.
- Develop test plans for app testing and debugging.
- Consider using Agile development methodology.
- Use communication tools and platforms for team coordination.
- Share code and collaborate using GitHub.

## Deliverables

- A functional web application.
- In-class demo of the web app.
- A PowerPoint presentation with screencaps demonstrating app functionality, user experience, development approaches, and individual team member contributions.

This project will require effective teamwork, software development skills, and attention to detail to create a successful Workout App that meets the specified requirements.
